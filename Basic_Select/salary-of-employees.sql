having a salary greater than $2000 per month who have been employees for less than 10 months. 
Sort your result by ascending employee_id.

| name        |  String    |
| months       |  Integer  |
| salary      |  Integer   |
+-------------+------------+

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, 
months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, 
and salary is their monthly salary.
